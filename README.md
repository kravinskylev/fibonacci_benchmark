## fibonacci_benchmark
These are code samples from a talk I gave about optimizing Ruby performance. The challenge I set for myself was to see if I could beat a naive implementation of the fibonacci sequence in a "fast" language with Ruby. This proved to be fairly easy, so I went balls to the wall and saw just how far I could push Ruby. The most fibonacci numbers my Ruby code generated in under a second was around 10,000,000. Suck it, Gophers/Java-ists/C-ers.

I'm recording a screencast of my talk this week and will be uploading it soon.
